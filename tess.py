"""Converts 2D polygon point geometry into triangles.

Usage:
  tess.py [input] [output]

The input file should be formatted like this:

10.34 10.234
10 50
60 50
60 10

20 30
25 40
30 30

40 30
45 20
50 30

Each line represents X and Y data for a point. Empty lines signify a
new path. Therefore this sample file contains three paths.

If the output file name is not given it spills to standard output. The
output will be formatted like this:

# test_data.dat --> Standard Output: 3 paths, 12 triangles
8 3 9 f f t
3 8 6 f f f
7 6 8 f f t
6 7 2 f f f
9 2 7 f f t
2 9 3 f f t
4 3 6 f f t
3 4 0 f f t
4 0 5 f f t
0 5 1 f f t
2 1 5 t f f
6 2 5 f f t

Each line has the format: idx0, idx1, idx2, edge0, edge1, edge2

The indexes refer to points in the order they appear in the input file.

The edges are true/false values. edge0 tells you if the line between
idx0 and idx1 is a shape boundary. edge1 is for idx1 to idx2, edge2 is
for idx2 to idx1.

        correct way and knows which edges are user-defined.

        Surface normal: the winding order of the points will on exit
        be defined such that it is in a right-handed coordinate
        system. Specifically: let vec1 run from p0 to p1, and vec2
        from p0 to p2. vec1 x vec2 is positive.

        Edges: Each edge of a triangle might be on the boundary of the
        shape, or it might be internal to the shape. An edge is True
        if it is on the boundary of the shape. We know it is on the
        boundary if the vertex indices are adjacent within a single
        path.

            [ [0, 1, 2, 3, 4], [5, 6, 7], [8, 9, 10] ]

        Use Shape's make_bound_tuples method to generate the list of
        tuples that looks like this: [ (0, 4), (5, 7), (8, 10) ], and
        pass that in as the 'bounds' parameter.
        
        Points 1 and 2 are adjacent (as are 2 and 1). Points 4 and 0
        are adjacent because lists are considered circular. Points 4
        and 5 are NOT adjacent because they come from different lists.

        With these path bounds and triangle verts at 6, 7, 9, the
        resulting triangle will have edges [True, False, False] since
        the first edge from 6 to 7 is a boundary, while the other two
